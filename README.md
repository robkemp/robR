##Personal R Package with Useful Functions

This package contains functions primarily for demography, exporting files, and using Census PUMS.
Some of them were written by me, some were taken from blogs.  I've done my best to attribute code properly,
but if you see something odd, let me know and I'll gladly make adjsutments.  

This package will continue to be updated with new functions and code as I write or need them.
